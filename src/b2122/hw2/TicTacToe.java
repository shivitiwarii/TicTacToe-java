/*
 * EE3206 Assignment 2
 * 
 * Your are required to implement the game interface TicTacToe below. There are 
 * seven abstract methods. In addition to these public methods, you may define 
 * other private fields and methods for your own use.
 *
 * Your class name must be TicTacToeXXXXXXXX where the X-string is your student ID.
 *
 * Your class must be in the same package of this interface (i.e. b2122.hw2)
 *
 * Your class must provide a no-arg constructor.
 *
 * You can run the main method in this interface to test your implementation.

 * with X. They take turns marking the spaces in a grid (usually 3x3 but can be NxN in this 
 * assignment). The player who succeeds in placing N respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
 * or diagonal row wins the game.
